[![](https://jitpack.io/v/marcelpinto/AnchorSheetBehavior.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#marcelpinto/AnchorSheetBehavior)


Modification of the BottomSheetBehavior with Anchor state.

Fine more about it at [the medium blog post](https://medium.com/@marxallski/from-bottomsheetbehavior-to-anchorsheetbehavior-262ad7997286#.m02n38t27).

# Integration 

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
Add AnchorSheetBehavior dependency:
```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.marcelpinto:AnchorSheetBehavior:master-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

# Usage

The behavior is an extension of the Android support design, thus the usage is the same.
The only addition is two extra states:
* STATE_ANCHOR: push the bottom sheet to an anchor state defined by Anchor offset
* STATE_FORCE_HIDE: force the bottom sheet to hide regardless of hideable flag

``` java
/**
* Set the offset for the anchor state. Number between 0..1
* i.e: Anchor the panel at 1/3 of the screen: setAnchorOffset(0.25)
*
* @param threshold {@link Float} from 0..1
*/
public void setAnchorOffset(float threshold) {
    this.mAnchorThreshold = threshold;
    this.mAnchorOffset = (int) Math.max(mParentHeight * mAnchorThreshold, mMinOffset);
}
```

For more usage see [Android docs](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/BottomSheetBehavior.html)
